        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>Space4Tomorrow is the brainchild of a young Ugandan boy that dared to dream of a sustainable future
            outer space. It was born out of a marriage of his two core passions; sustainability and space. At a time
            when everyone is preoccupied with saving earths environment, very little attention is given to our
            next homes environment, especially at such a time when both national and private actors are involved in activities in space. The project aims to advocate for and push for sustainability of outer space
            following the following agenda;</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>The demilitarisation of outer space.</b> This includes the removal of equipment, material and
                    agenda that is aimed at being used for military purposes, including subtle agenda, such as strategic
                    placing of spy satellites. This particular agenda aims at reducing the amount of money spent by states
                    on weaponisation, which stands at just about 5 billion dollars each single day.
                    ii. The removal of nuclear sources from outer space. Currently, there is are discussions of using
                    nuclear sources on various projects in outer space, and indeed some have been already placed and
                    used there, posing a threat to the pristine climate of the space environment. This threat is EVEN graver
                    given that cleaning up the harm that a nuclear leak in outer space would cause is a very costly
                    procedure. This initiative shall advocate for the removal of nuclear sources from outer space.
                    iii. Support research in sustainability of space resources. This agenda shall encompass research
                    initiatives in how space resources may be conserved for the future use of all mankind. This research
                    shall be available through given channels that shall be created by the project for access to key space
                    actors and the general public.</li>
                <li><b>Management of space debris.</b> This shall be the final agenda of the initiative, aimed at
                    advocating for the management of space debris, which is a continuous risk to space exploration and
                    exploitation and a lurking danger to all space actors and equipment, and therefore, an impediment to
                    space scientific research and development.
                    Currently, the project is administered by two friends, Kasibante David and Kaddu Jeffery Suubi, with
                    three volunteers and was formally inaugurated on 5th September 2019.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        <h2>Project Modus Operendi</h2>
        <p>In pursuance of its set objectives, then project shall employ a number of methods, aimed at creating
            full impact at minimum cost, since funding is currently unavailable and all current project activities are
            self and personally funded from the members finances. However, with future availability of funds, the
            members hope to engage in more capital-intensive efforts in pursuance of the set objectives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The project targets people all over the world, although cantered in Uganda, and targets people of all
            age groups, as human stakeholders and the corporeal stakeholders are also considered in some of the
            methods the project aims to employ. Below are some of the methods and initiatives that the project
            shall engage in in the next three years.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Social Media Campaign.</b> This is the initial endeavour that the project is in the process of
                    employing. This involves the opening and management of accounts on the main social media platforms.
                    These include Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter. These were specifically chosen due to their
                    huge following and thus the capability of information shared through these channels reaching a
                    wide audience, in addition to the maneuverability of the chosen channels. The project shall also run a
                    blog and a website later on when the manpower and technical assistance for these channels becomes
                    available. Currently, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts are operative, and other channels shall be fully
                    operative by the end of year 2020. The pages shall be used to disburse information on project activities
                    and interface with different stakeholders.</li>
                <li><b>Public Lectures.</b> The project also shall engage in public lectures in different academic
                    institutions. These shall be aimed at invigorating academic discourse and interest in space- related
                    activities, sustainability and research. Lecture notes shall be prepared and shared with students in the
                    institutions where the lectures shall be delivered. Key academics shall be contacted for the purposes
                    of delivering such lectures, to encourage professional discourse.</li>
                <li><b>Collaborations and Engagements with Key Actors.</b> There are various actors in the space
                    industry, both governmental and private. The project recognises that its objectives may only be fully
                    achieved through engaging with these actors. As such, the project aims at making contact with
                    national stakeholders like the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, external and global
                    sector growers such as the European Space Agency, NASA, SpaceX, various national space agencies
                    and other key actors. So far, the project management has established links with some persons within
                    the European Space Agency, SpaceX, the Angolan National Space Agency and the South African National
                    Space Agency and hopes to strengthen those ties, along with further engagement with other actors.</li>
                <li><b>Mass Media.</b> Another of the methods of operation that the project shall employ is engaging
                    various media outlets for interviews, columns and articles raising awareness on various space activities.
                    This is aimed at reaching all levels of the society in which the project runs. There are already various
                    programs that focus on science running on various radio and television stations and it is
                    established that a substantial number of people listen to and watch these programs. The project aims
                    to utilise these media to realise public debate on the foregoing matters in the space industry. Such
                    awareness at the grass root levels shall ensure that the project receives relevance in the society it is
                    situated in.</li>
                <li><b>Student engagement.</b> The project aims at engaging students in different institutions through
                    various activities in order to raise interest in space sustainability. A key group of collaborators in many
                    of the project activities shall be students and in order to tap into this resource, the project shall
                    engage in various student-based activities. Key among these shall be competitions, especially
                    essay-writing competitions and hackathons. Other initiatives like inter-school debates shall also be
                    employed, depending on the availability of resources and funding.</li>
                <li><b>Themed Events.</b> These shall be held depending on availability. The project aims at joining the rest
                    of the world in celebrating key events and holidays related to space. These shall be organised to
                    physically engage the society in project activities, raise awareness and also add fun to the whole space
                    idea. These events shall include family picnics, outdoor cinema, street marches and star gazing, among
                    others. The events shall be aimed at arousing a sense of wonder and respect for space as the last
                    heritage of humankind, and in turn, inspire them to root for further project activities.</li>
                <li><b>Attendance of space conferences.</b> Many such events are organised annually in different
                    locations of the world, each with different themes. The project aims at facilitating or seeking
                    facilitation for selected members to attend these events, submit papers, and participate in the
                    events. The aim of this is to gain exposure and interact with other players in the space regime, for
                    guidance and inspiration, which are very key tenets in the realisation the project goals. In this, the
                    project aims at having its members attend at least two space conferences each year based on
                    different themes.</li>
                <li><b>Pursuance of further education.</b> Currently, none of the members who run the project has
                    specialised qualifications in space matters, though they all have specialised knowledge in the same
                    garnered from their academic interactions with the sector. The project shall, as such aim at educating its members by facilitating further studies, either in short courses or advanced
                    courses in space related matters. For starters, the project founder has been admitted at the Leiden
                    University for the September intake, in 2021 for an Advanced Masters degree in International Air and
                    Space Law. Other members shall also be facilitated thus for similar courses. This is aimed at building
                    the knowledge base of the project for more effective impact</li>
                <li><b>Organisation of a space conference.</b> Within the next two years, the project aims at organising
                    a space conference within Uganda, the first of its kind. In this, it hopes to make collaborations with other
                    actors, such as the Space Generation Advisory Council and the Ministry of Science, Technology and
                    Innovation to bring together major world players, writers, policy makers and other dignitaries to
                    discuss matters around sustainability of space resources with particular focus on the African
                    Continent. This conference shall be a gateway to even more engagements and a lot of publicity shall
                    surround it, giving the public the opportunity to learn about space and sustainability of space resources,
                    which is expected to give rise to a demand for accountability and further measures to ensure the same.</li>
            </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2> 
        <p>It is anticipated that the project shall be a pioneer for many other such projects and organisations
            within the East and Central African region and in Africa at large, as no such project or organisation
            currently exists. It shall demystify the mystery that surrounds space and raise awareness on how space
            resources should be best appropriated to create and foster their sustainability. The project shall
            engage in a number of activities that are expected to entice students and the academia within the
            African region to pursue careers in space, which is also expected to develop Africa’s space sector,
            fostering growth and development within the region.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Projected Running Time</h2>
        <p>The project had expected to begin most of its activities in January 2020, but began in August 2019 with
            the engagements in the USA, although some groundwork has already commenced, and shall have a
            quarterly review of performance and an annual review at the end of the year. Based on these reviews,
            the project may modify its objectives and activities to fit into the projected goals for the next year. It is
            expected that the project shall run in perpetuity, and be fully registered as a 501 (c) organisation by
            2021.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Project Beneficiaries</h2>
