        <h3>Preserving Humanity's Last Inheritance</h3>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Since dawn of time, humanity has taken keen interest in outer space, that large expanse just outside
            the earths atmosphere. More importantly, humanity has taken even keener interest in the vast
            opportunities that such an area provides, especially in its resources and qualities. By and large,
            humanity has since stopped envying outer space through telescopes and has stepped there, sent
            sentinels and human ambassadors, from Yuri Gagarin to the last astronaut on the International Space
            Station.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With continuous engagement with this resource, humanity has quickly discovered that it is humanitys
            last chance at survival and growth. For this reason, the Outer Space Treaty, the standing rex specialis on
            outer space and even the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks Treaty II recognise that outer space
            should be preserved for the benefit of all human kind and should only be used for peaceful purposes..</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Like all resources, outer space faces the grave danger that often comes with uncontrolled, unlimited
            and wanton interaction with human projects. What first appeared like a vast land, full of potential to
            the first settlers in present day USA, is no longer what it is today, riddled with pollution, disease and
            facing near-possible destruction. Furthermore, as we have soon realised, the cost of cleaning up
            pollution is proving to be far higher than incurred while creating and spreading pollutants. This is the
            fate that faces outer space and its resources. Furthermore, any wanton act in outer space may incur
            more damage than would on earth, since outer space has quite different qualities and climate than is
            on the surface of earth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since the end of the Second World War, USA and Russia have engaged in an arms race, and though
            the SALT treaties put an end to this, the race had attracted a number of new participants, with even
            more sophistication. The newest wave is in militarisation of space objects and craft. While the earliest
            participants in space were only USA and Russia, a number of other states have since joined the quest
            with some countries, such as China having multiple satellites in orbit around the earth. There is fear
            that, with rising political tensions on earth, outer space may become even more militarised than it is.
            This may take the form of employing spy satellites in Near Earth Orbit, weapon sing space craft and
            objects, placing non-conventional weapons into space, among others.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While the utilisation of outer space and its resources is of paramount importance to all of humanity, it
            is mitigated by the intrusion of space debris, either human-created or natural. There is a pressing
            need to have this debris managed to ensure the smooth operation of space activities.</p>
